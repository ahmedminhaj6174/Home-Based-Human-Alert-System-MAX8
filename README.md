# Home-Based-Human-Alert-System-MAX8

The Home-Based Human Alert System was envisioned to detect unknown human faces in real-time and alerting the user with timely response and recording evidence for the objective of infant monitoring and intruder detection.

Our A Home-Based Human Alert System detects human faces and after detection, it triggers three events simultaneously. 1) A warning sound. 2) Screenshots is taken of the detected faces and saved it in the computer. 3) Starts audio recording of the nearby environment and the audio file is saved in computer. Both screenshot images and recorded audio file is saved in current date and time. If no faces are detected, the system does not trigger the three events.

Steps to launch the program:
1. Unzip the FaceTune-A Home Based Human Alert System.zip file in your computer.
2. Go inside the FaceTune-A Home Based Human Alert System folder and open the facetune.maxpat file. Make sure the facetune.maxpat file and music1.mp3 are in the same directory.
3. In the facetune patch click the toggle button (On / Off System) at the top to launch the system. The system will automatically shutdown after the faces are detected.
4. The captured screenshots and recorded audio file will be saved automatically in the same directory where the facetune.maxpat file is located.
5. If there is any issue with the system quit the facetune patch and open it again to launch the system.
